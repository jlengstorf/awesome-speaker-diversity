# Welcoming Diversity in Tech Means Reaching Out

Recently, I got into [a debate about diversity](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6f8u2s/githubs_electronconf_postponed_because_all_the/digz7hb/) on Reddit, and it bummed me out.

The [ElectronConf](http://electronconf.com/) roster was 100% men, despite a blind review process. This points to a big issue: **there wasn't any diversity in the proposals to begin with, so the roster was doomed to be skewed.** Personally, I don't believe any of this was due to malice or ill intent, but an oversight on the part of the conference organizers to welcome proposals from a more diverse group of developers.

We can make this easier for conferences everywhere: this is a (far from exhaustive) list of developer groups we can reach out to during calls for proposals to make sure we're welcoming everyone in tech at our conferences.

Everyone is welcome in tech. Let's make an effort to extend that welcome.

## How this list works.

If you're planning an event, put together a simple email that says something like this:

> Hi, there!
> 
> I'm one of the organizers of {{CONF_NAME}}, and we're looking for speakers. We wanted to reach out to your community directly to let you know the call for proposals is open at {{CFP_LINK}}. We think the members of your group could offer a lot to our attendees, and we'd like to invite them all to submit ideas.
> 
> You can find out more about the conference at {{CONF_LINK}}, or reach out to me directly with any questsions.
>
> If you're comfortable with it, we'd really appreciate it if you'd share the CFP with your community.
>
> Thanks!  
> {{YOUR_NAME}}

You can send this email to every group at once, if you'd like — though it'd probably pay dividends to personalize it a bit — and this ensures that your CFP is seen in as many communities as possible, encouraging submissions from a diverse group of developers and driving up the quality of the talks at your event.
