## How this list works.

If you're planning an event, put together a simple email that says something like this:

> Hi, there!
> 
> I'm one of the organizers of {{CONF_NAME}}, and we're looking for speakers. We wanted to reach out to your community directly to let you know the call for proposals is open at {{CFP_LINK}}. We think the members of your group could offer a lot to our attendees, and we'd like to invite them all to submit ideas.
> 
> You can find out more about the conference at {{CONF_LINK}}, or reach out to me directly with any questions.
>
> If you're comfortable with it, we'd really appreciate it if you'd share the CFP with your community.
>
> Thanks!  
> {{YOUR_NAME}}

You can send this email to every group at once, if you'd like — though it'd probably pay dividends to personalize it a bit — and this ensures that your CFP is seen in as many communities as possible, encouraging submissions from a diverse group of developers and driving up the quality of the talks at your event.

## Why?

Recently, I got into [a debate about diversity](https://www.reddit.com/r/javascript/comments/6f8u2s/githubs_electronconf_postponed_because_all_the/digz7hb/) on Reddit, and it bummed me out.

The [ElectronConf](http://electronconf.com/) roster was 100% men, despite a blind review process. This points to a big issue: **there wasn't any diversity in the proposals to begin with, so the roster was doomed to be skewed.** Personally, I don't believe any of this was due to malice or ill intent, but an oversight on the part of the conference organizers to welcome proposals from a more diverse group of developers.

We can make this easier for conferences everywhere: this is a (far from exhaustive) list of developer groups we can reach out to during calls for proposals to make sure we're welcoming everyone in tech at our conferences.

Inviting a broader group of developers to submit proposals means more proposals, better conferences, more value for attendees, and a strong message to the tech community: **you are welcome here.**
